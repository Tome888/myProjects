To begin the project, the first step is to start the Python server responsible for authentication. Without running this server, you will not be able to access the user dashboard, and features like commenting and applying filters on the website will be unavailable.

To start the authentication server, open the PowerShell terminal in the main project directory and run the following command: python '.\REST API\authenticator.py'

Use the following username and password combinations to log into the site:

Username: User123 | Password: Pass123
Username: User456 | Password: Pass456
Username: User789 | Password: Pass789
